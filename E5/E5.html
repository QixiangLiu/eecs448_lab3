    <h2>2013 Season</h2>
    <p>Lee "Faker" Sang-hyeok was pulled out of solo queue by the SK Telecom organization so that a team could be formed around him in the mid lane.Ultimately they settled on Impact, bengi, Piglet, and PoohManDu to surround him and the team was unveiled in February of 2013, dubbed SK Telecom T1 2. They qualified for their first OGN at OLYMPUS Champions Spring 2013. </p>
    <h2>2014 Season</h2>
    <p>The new season started even better for K at PANDORA.TV Champions Winter 2013-2014. They didn't lose a single game and put up the greatest performance a team has ever had at an OGN tournament. They swept Samsung Ozone in the finals and Faker proved himself as the greatest LoL player of all time after just a year. However the success wasn't meant to last after ManDu stepped down due to health issues and the team picked up Casper.</p>
    <h2>2015 Season</h2>
    <p>Changes to the OGN rules forced K and S to merge, forming SK Telecom T1. Most of the old K roster was removed, except for Bengi and Faker, while MaRin, Wolf, and Bang filled out the rest of the line-up. Easyhoon and Faker shared the starting mid lane spot for SBENU Champions Spring 2015, to the disappointment of many fans who wanted to see Faker play in every game.</p>
    <h2 class="season6">2016 Season</h2>
    <p>Two weeks after the World Championship, SK Telecom played in the LoL KeSPA Cup. In their semifinal series against Challenger team Ever, substitute mid laner Scout started in the first game, but even with Faker playing in the second game, the team lost the series 0-2 - continuing a streak of World Champions being eliminated early on in their first tournaments after Worlds.</p>
